# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
<br>
#Credit card fraud involves the unauthorized use of a credit or debit card, or similar payment mechanism, to fraudulently obtain money or property.
<br>
#To prevent this I have made an Machine Learning Model that Predicts on the basis of given Inputs that the Transaction is Legid or Fraudlent
<br>
# Dataset used - Credit Card Transaction details from wwww.kaggle.com. Dataset is Classified Dataset that has 0 for Legid Transaction and 1 for Fraudlent Transaction
<br>
#The dataset was highly Unbalanced so I performed SMOTE Analysis for Over Sampling and performed NEAR-MISS Technique for UNdersampling of the Classification based Dataset and applied 6 Machine Learning Algorithms names:
<br>
# Logistic Regression, Random-Forest Classifier, ADABoost Classifier, MLP Classifier, Naive Bayes Classifier, Support Vector Machine Classifier.
<br>
#After applying all the 6 Datasets on Over sampled and UNder sampled Dataset respectively, 
<br>
#Calculed all the Metrics Score such as Accuracy, RAC_AUC Score, F1 score, R2 score, Mean Absolute Error, Confusion Matrix
